# BankCustomerChurn-

I build Tableau dashboard Bank Customer Churn Analysis.

It's a lot more expensive to attract new customers,compared to retaing the current ones.Hight customer churn when clients leave, or switch banks can significantly impact profitability and growth.

This project is aimed to analyze customer churn in the banking industry and provide meaningful insights to stakeholders.

Result:

✅ Churn by Gender:

Females have a higher churn rate (25.07%) compared to males (16.47%).

This suggests different customer experiences that may require tailored retention strategies.

✅ Churn by Number of Products:

Customers with only 1 product have a high churn rate (27.71%), meaning single-product users are at risk.

Multi-product users (2 products) churn much less (7.60%), but churn spikes significantly at 3+ products (82.71% for 3, 100% for 4 products), suggesting dissatisfaction with additional products.

✅ Churn by Country:

Germany has the highest churn rate (32.4%), meaning customers in this region may require better engagement strategies.

France (16.1%) and Spain (16.6%) have much lower churn rates, suggesting more stability in these regions.

✅ Churn by Age Group:

Customers aged 45-60 years old have the highest churn rate, indicating that older customers may be less engaged or have different banking needs.

✅ Churn by Card Type:

Diamond cardholders have the highest churn, suggesting potential dissatisfaction with premium banking services.

Gold cardholders have the lowest churn, meaning this segment is the most loyal.

✅ Churn by Tenure 

Tenure (years with the bank) does not significantly impact churn, meaning loyalty is not necessarily built over time.
